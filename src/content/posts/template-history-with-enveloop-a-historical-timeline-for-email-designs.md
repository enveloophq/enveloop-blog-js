Enveloop is a developer-focused message builder and API that makes it easy to design &amp; send beautiful emails and texts from your app using one simple implementation. You can sign up for free at: [https://app.enveloop.com](https://app.enveloop.com).Ever held back from experimenting with your email template designs because you were afraid of losing something important? We're excited to introduce **Template History** in Enveloop – a feature that gives you the freedom to explore new design directions while keeping your previous work just a click, or in our case, a slider away.

### Design Without Limits, Create Without FearTemplate Timeline transforms how you approach email design by eliminating the "what if I mess this up?" worry. Now you can:

- Freely experiment with bold new designs- Try different copy variations without losing your original text- Test new layouts knowing you can always go back- Keep a living archive of your design evolution- Revisit seasonal designs from last year
Your design history is a treasure trove of ideas and sometimes your best inspiration for something new comes from your own past work. Template History allows you to use a slider to drift back in time and see how your user communication has evolved.

### Perfect for Creative TeamsFor bigger teams using Enveloop, Template History can work like a shared design system. You can:

- Browse through design iterations for inspiration- Reference past versions during creative discussions- Learn from historical changes and improvements- Maintain brand consistency by referencing previous work
Plus, if any work is mistakenly overwritten, it's super-easy to pull back the last good design and progress forward.
