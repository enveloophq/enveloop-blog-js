Highlighted below are a couple of ways you and your team can take advantage of tagging in Enveloop:

### Adding and Editing Tags

To add a tag, open Template options and select "Manage Tags". From there, you can add a comma-delimited set of tags for a template. To edit or remove a tag, you follow the same procedure, changing or removing tags on the template.

### Filtering Views Using Tags

Once you have added tags to templates, you can filter the template lists to only show templates that have the selected tags. This helps your team to divide templates between uses, clients, funnel stage, or other descriptor.
