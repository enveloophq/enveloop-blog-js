Hey there, we're Enveloop – a developer-focused message builder and API that makes it easy to design & send emails and texts from your app using one simple call.

Enveloop enables you, as a developer, to design, test, and deliver messages to different places using different formats.

### Why we built Enveloop

Developers create apps. These apps, well, need to talk to users. Simple, right?

Unfortunately — multiple APIs, maintaining message content, design standards, delivery standards, handling failure/retry -- you have to figure it all out and, over time, **it all becomes scattered in your code**.

_Worse_ — it’s inaccessible to those that need to edit the messaging because the design & content is buried in your code with all the implementation details — as a developer, that puts **you** in the middle of any update, big or small. Gross.

We’ve built a service that solves user messaging. It’s simple for developers, collaborative for consultants and their clients, and ready for fast-moving product & development teams. **It’s Enveloop**.

### What Enveloop Offers

* A powerful but simple-to-use message builder.
* Intuitive formatting optimized for developers. (Support for Markdown & Mustache)
* Elegant templates that allow you to get started fast without needing a designer.
* Delegation of content messaging to others on your team (or to your clients!).
* A single API that supports multiple message types and providers.
* Integration with multiple delivery platforms (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES).

### Just Getting Started

Along with our powerful editor, we include many message integrations. We have plans for more great features, including more integrations, message types, workflows, and useful analytics. We'll keep you posted!
