In this short article, we're talking about a special type of section: **Shared Sections**.

In previous articles focusing building messages in Enveloop, we've talked about:

- [Templates](https://blog.enveloop.com/enveloop-templates/)- [Designing Messages](https://blog.enveloop.com/designing-messages-in-enveloop/)
Often, once you have designed your initial message, there are numerous areas of the message that will be consistent from message to message. An easy example of this are headers &amp; footers.

### So, what are Shared Sections?**Shared Sections** create *global* groups of content/styles â€“ linked inside of multiple message templates. For example, it's common to have all the message you send out use the same header information and design.

In Enveloop, you can craft a message header, save it as a Shared Section, and add it to all your messages. When you need to make a change, the header is automatically updated in all your message templates.

Let's talk about how to to create a Shared Section and, once created, how to link to other message templates.

### Creating a Shared SectionBefore you can create a Shared Section, you have to have a section to save -- which means, you'll need to create a section. ðŸ˜„ Often, by the time you want to have a global section to use, you'll have already created something you want to easily share to other messages.

The important thing to know: The first step is to create the base section inside one of your message templates.

*To create a shared section, first add a normal section to your message and add in content &amp; styling.*
Once you have [built out a section using the Enveloop message builder](https://blog.enveloop.com/designing-messages-in-enveloop/), from the Section options, you can click **Add to Shared Sections**. Give the section a name and you are all set. 

In the example below, you can see that we have created a header area and now we want to transform it into a Shared Section.

![](https://blog.enveloop.com/content/images/2023/01/create-saved-section.gif)You can create a shared section using an existing section in a message template.The content of your section no longer exists in your template, but is now *linked* to it. The Section options you normally see are hidden (you'll need to edit the new Shared Section to see these settings).

You can access Shared Sections for a project using the navigation in the left-side panel.

![](https://blog.enveloop.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-4.10.16-PM.png)**Success!** We've now created a Shared Section. You can use this content in your message templates and have global control of the content and styles contained inside the section. Let's talk briefly about how to do that!

### Linking a Shared Section to a TemplateNow that you have a Shared Section available, adding it into a template is easy -- just like adding a regular section. Click the **Add Section** button in your template, and you'll have a **Shared Sections** tab available. Select the shared section and it's added to your template. Order the section in the list of sections in your template and you're set!

![](https://blog.enveloop.com/content/images/2023/01/add-saved-section-to-template.gif)You can add a Shared Section to your message template in the same way that you add a normal section.### Unlinking a Shared SectionYou can remove a Shared Section by clicking the Trash icon. Deleting a shared section from your template will not delete it globally â€“ it simply unlinks it from your message template.

Also, if you place a Shared Section into a message template and would like to make it a *normal* section in the template, no longer linked to any changes made in the global Shared Section, you can choose to *unlink* the section.

This allows you to keep the content and styles of that global section in your template, but it will now be unique again.

Plus, these special sections allow you to make an update in one spot and have all your templates immediately updated.
