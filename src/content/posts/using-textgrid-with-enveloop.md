Developers can now send text (SMS/MMS) messages, via TextGrid, using Enveloop templates and the Enveloop API!

Enveloop is a developer-focused message builder and API that makes it easy to design &amp; send beautiful emails and texts from your app using one simple implementation. You can sign up for free at: [https://app.enveloop.com](https://app.enveloop.com).While it can seem that much of the world sends text messages via Twilio, there are really nice, and often less expensive, alternatives that could work better for startups. One of the ones we have discovered recently is [TextGrid](https://textgrid.com).

We've added full support, in Enveloop, for sending SMS and MMS messages via the TextGrid platform.

It's simple to get started -- here's how to do it!

### Setting up TextGridOnce you have created and logged into your TextGrid account:

1. $12. $1
### Setting up a Phone Number in TextGrid*(If you have not set up a phone number in TextGrid yet, follow these steps as part of the setup process.)*

Now that you are logged into TextGrid and you have created and accessed your authentication information for TextGrid, you'll need to add a phone number.

1. $12. $13. $14. $1
The phone number will be available in Enveloop once you add your TextGrid authentication settings in the following steps.

### Setting up Enveloop to use TextGridAfter logging into your Enveloop account:

ðŸ’¡Sending SMS/MMS messages via Enveloop is available starting with our ****Starter**** plans and above. [Let us know](mailto: support@enveloop.com) if we can help!1. $12. $13. $14. $1
Once this is pulled up, you can add in the **Account SID** and the **Auth Token** that you accessed from your TextGrid account (in the previous steps).

### Adding Default NumberNow that you have this account information configured, the available **Default From Numbers** will populate in the dropdown. Select the number you want to use when sending messages from this Enveloop project.

### Boom, done!That's it! You are set up and any text messages you send through your Enveloop project. We'd love to help you get started. It's [free to sign up for Enveloop](https://app.enveloop.com) and if you have any questions, reach out to us at: [hey@enveloop.com](mailto: hey@enveloop.com).
