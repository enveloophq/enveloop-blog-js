The team has been hard at work through the first of the year and now we have exciting changes to talk about in this update! I will keep it brief, but will be following up with more detail about this exciting release in upcoming posts ‚Äì be on the lookout for it!

‚ù§Ô∏èBefore we dive in, a quick note that we have [****Launched on Product Hunt****](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/enveloop-2)! ü•≥ We'd love for you to visit right quick and give us some upvote love. Appreciate your help!*(If you don't happen to do this already, *[*Product Hunt*](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/enveloop-2)* is great daily stop to see all the fun/amazing tools being built by developers around the world!)*

**Ok, let's dive in!**

We've received lots of great feedback and have added in some powerful new features that are available right now. These include:

### Enveloop is now a full email providerNormally, our users would need to configure a third-party sender, but many of our customers were looking for a full end-to-end experience that would allow them to migrate away from older providers. We've added it!

### Completely re-imagined logs &amp; monitoringLet's face it, most logging in existing email providers is painful to use. So, we spent time re-imagining it. We've made it super-responsive, full of powerful live-filtering, and let you quickly see all the details you need.

### Enve-LoopingReleasing a powerful way to wrangle mustache to iterate content via data tables was a big step forward for dynamic content in emails. Now, you can do it with any content, in any section, in both emails and text.

### Flexible WebhooksCustomers now have full access to customizable webhooks, allowing them to connect numerous services, internal &amp; external, to messaging events. Add as many as you need, all with a simple UI!

The team is so excited about these new capabilities and we can't wait to see what all you do with them! More detail soon!

As always, it's [completely free to get started with Enveloop](https://app.enveloop.com). Start the new year with less cruft in your app while empowering your team to have greater control over the valuable messaging you send your customers!

Happy Sending!
