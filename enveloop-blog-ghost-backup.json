Once you know about a\npotential change, get it in the system, and the dashboard will make sure it does\nnot get lost.\n\nThe dashboard puts the status of all your changes at your fingertips.Startup\nDocuments, issues, tasks, Closeout Documents\nThe dashboard lets you track all the Startup/Closeout Documents, issues, and\ntasks for all of your subcontractors in the same place you track your\nfinancials. Nothing stalls a jobsite like paperwork, so we help you make sure\nyour paperwork is in place.\n\nWe've designed the dashboard to be intuitive. Once you start working with it,\nyou'll quickly be able to navigate it without a second thought, just like you do\nyour phone.\n\nWe'll walk through each of your workflows in more detail in a series of\nfollow-up blog posts.

Sometimes they're not engaging or creative at all, which really ruins that initial excitement when something new pops in your inbox.\n\nEvery message that comes from your company is an extension of your brand. You wouldn't skimp on the creativity of your marketing campaigns, so why would you in your transactional emails?\n\nThat's why it's so important to optimize transactional emails. After all, these are the messages that people are often waiting for - whether it's a confirmation of an order or a password reset request. If these emails are poorly designed and lack personality, they're likely to disappoint. However, if they're well-crafted and engaging, they can provide a real boost to customer satisfaction.\n\n\nConsistency is Key\n\nHave you ever bought something online and then received a confirmation email that looked like it was written by a completely different company? It's confusing, right? You might assume it’s just a scam. This is why consistency is important in transactional emails. You want your customers to have a good impression of your company, and using the same template for different things will help you show your customers that you are legitimate.\n\n\nCreating Cohesion\n\nThe inbox is a crowded place. You have to be able to stand out. Creating a cohesive look that is immediately recognizable as being from your company is one of the best ways to do that. One of the most important things to remember is to use the same color schemes throughout your email. Another quick way is to use the same logo that is on your website and other marketing materials.\n\n\nLess is More\n\nYou don't want to use a lot of fancy fonts or decorations that will make it hard for your customers to read the email.

In this blog post, we'll share some tips for using color in your transactional emails so that they are both attractive and effective.\n\n\nCreate a Sense of Urgency\n\nWhen used carefully, color can create a sense of urgency and encourage your customers to take action.\n\nFor example, red and yellow = excitement and vibrancy, making them ideal choices for transactional emails that seek to generate a sense of urgency.\n\nToo much of one color can be off-putting and overwhelming, so use it sparingly.\n\n\nMatch your Brand\n\nWhen customers see your colors in their inboxes, they’ll instantly recognize your brand and feel more confident opening your emails. You want your customers’ mind to automatically associate your brand with your colors. Using consistent colors across all of your communications will help do so. In the example below, DoorDash uses their brand's main color in this email to match the words that are the main focus of this email.\n\n\nEye-Catching & Easy on the Eyes\n\nLike we talked about earlier, too much of any color can be overwhelming. Color should be used strategically so that your emails are not only readable, but also eye-catching. The best way to achieve this is by using a high contrast between the background and the text.\n\nFor example, if you have a light background, use dark text, and vice versa. You can also use color to highlight important information, such as CTAs or deadlines.\n\nIn this email from Overtone, a company that sells hair dye, they use their product to add a pop of color while leaving the rest of the email black and white, so the color truly stands out.\n\n\nMake a Statement\n\nWhile a consistent color palette is important for maintaining your brand's identity, there are times when using a different color can be effective.\n\nFor example, using a brighter or bolder version of your brand's color can help to emphasize important information.

As a brief reminder, Enveloop messages are structured this way:\n\n\nflowchart TB\nid1([Template]) --> id2([Sections]) --> id3([Elements])\n\n\nA Template acts as a container for your content.

An easy example of this are headers & footers.\n\n\nSo, what are Shared Sections?\n\nShared Sections create global groups of content/styles – linked inside of multiple message templates. For example, it's common to have all the message you send out use the same header information and design.\n\nIn Enveloop, you can craft a message header, save it as a Shared Section, and add it to all your messages.

When your users or potential customers visit your site:\n\n * Is it clear what they need to do and are those steps minimal?\n * Is the experience fast and effortless?\n * Do you have consistent and familiar design and branding at all the touch points?\n\nAll these characteristics drive the simplicity your users need to ensure they're successful opening the front door and on the right path. That said, the best impression we need to make is often the first impression.\n\nThat first impression is often the Sign Up / Login / Authentication interaction.\n\nIn this article, we are going to dive into blending two powerful tools together, Stytch and Enveloop, and demonstrate how easy it can be for you to tighten up this inteaction and send optimized, designed, and easy-to-use welcome/invite authentication \"magic link\" emails to your users.\n\n\nStarting out with Stytch and Enveloop\n\nFirst, we'll spend some time talking about the process, describing the various technologies and services we'll use. Then, we'll provide you with all the code you'll need to get everything running smoothly.\n\nAuthentication: Stytch\nStytch's authentication platform and flexible API and SDK’s let developers build secure, intuitive login flows your customers will love, with tools your team will thank you for.\n\nAt Enveloop, we're big fans of Stytch!\n\nMessaging: Enveloop\nEnveloop's message builder and simple API and SDK's allow developers to easily send and log emails, texts, and more for their web and mobile applications. Our team is passionate about empowering developers to send better messages with increase deliverability.\n\nIf you haven't signed up for Stytch or Enveloop, now is a great time to do this! 😎\n\nOk, let's get started!\n\n\nSo, what are magic links?\n\nTo allow your users to authenticate to your app via Stytch, we'll be using Magic Links.\n\nMagic Links, one of Stytch’s many auth products, provide users with a frictionless and passwordless login experience. Magic Links are essentially single-use login URLs that can be embedded in communications like email. They’re quick, easy, and flexible to implement.\n\n💡Information for how to use Embeddable Magic Links can be found in the Stytch API Docs. You will need Stytch to provide access to the Create Embeddable Magic Link endpoint by emailing support@stytch.com.\n\nStytch has an Email Magic Link product that sends emails, which include the Magic Link that authenticates a user to your app and establishes a session. By default, you can use this option.\n\nHowever, there are reasons why you and your team would want greater control over these authentication emails. They include:\n\n * You may already have a email provider set up (SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark, etc.) and you want all messaging to issue through your domains at these providers.\n * You want better design/branding/content control over the authentication emails that are sent to your new and existing users.\n\nBy using Enveloop to send your emails and Stytch’s Embeddable Magic Links, you get the best of both worlds – seamless authentication for your users and full control of your email templates to maintain a consistent login experience for your users.\n\n💡If you haven't set up a provider and want to use Enveloop, no worries! We give you 100 free messages just for signing up!\n\nNow that you know why you'd want to combine these services, let's show you how to make it happen!\n\n\nCreate a message template in Enveloop\n\nWe'll start out by logging into Enveloop and creating a new \"Magic Link Login\" template. To do this inside a project:\n\n 1. Select Add Template.\n 2. Choose to create an Email template.\n 3. From the gallery, based on a design, choose Magic Link Login template.\n\nStarting with a pre-designed and coded template from Enveloop is a great way to save yourself a lot of work as a developer. You can choose a basic template or one that includes more color and style.\n\nIn the template layout, you'll notice a button. Clicking on the button, you'll notice that the value of the Url field is set to {{{ url }}}, a variable. This is Mustache syntax -- we'll show a bit later how this variable will tie into Stytch and the call to the Enveloop API to send the message.\n\nPerfect! Now that we have an email template to use, we can dive into Stytch to create an Embeddable Magic Link.\n\n\nCreate an Embeddable Magic Link token using Stytch\n\nNow that the message template is set up in Enveloop, let's focus on how to create the Embeddable Magic Link token that will be called in the {{{ url }}}variable that's assigned to the Log In button in our message template.\n\nWe'll show the steps you'll need to take to do this and then show code examples for this effort using NodeJS.\n\n\nStep 1: Find a Stytch User Based on Email Address\n\nBefore generating a token, which takes a Stytch user_id, we'll need to find the user we want to create the Magic Link for. To look up an existing Stytch user based on email address, you will need to use the Search Users endpoint. To create a new user in Stytch, you will need to use the Create User endpoint.\n\n💡It is probably best to store an external foreign key to the Stytch user_id in your User model.\n\n\nStep 2: Generate an Embeddable Magic Link Token for the User\n\nTo generate the Embeddable Magic Link token, call the Create Magic Link endpoint from the Stytch API.\n\nUse the token in the Create Magic Link response to create a URL to pass to your Enveloop email template. The redirect URL should looks something like this:\n\nhttps://yourapp.com/auth?token=MAGIC_LINK_TOKEN&stytch_token_type=magic_links\n\nWe'll pass this to the {{{ url }}} variable when sending your email with Enveloop and calling the Enveloop API.\n\n\nStep 3: Authenticate the Embeddable Magic Link Token when the User clicks to log in\n\nCall the Stytch Authenticate Magic Link endpoint to redeem the token. And that’s it! You now have a beautiful custom login email from Enveloop, powered by Stytch authentication.\n\nOk, so let's see how the code for this would look\n\n\nNow, the code!\n\nUsing the steps outlined above, here is an example of how that interaction would look in NodeJS and Express, using the Stytch SDK and the Enveloop SDK for NodeJS:\n\n\nSet Up Stytch and Enveloop Clients\n\nconst stytch = require('stytch')\nconst stytchBase = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? stytch.envs.live : stytch.envs.test\nconst stytchClient = new stytch.Client({\n  project_id: process.env.STYTCH_PROJECT_ID,\n  secret: process.env.STYTCH_SECRET_KEY,\n  env: stytchBase,\n})\n\nconst Enveloop = require('enveloop')\nconst enveloop = new Enveloop({ apiKey: process.env.ENVELOOP_API_TOKEN })\n\n\nUse the Express Endpoint Function to Handle Form Submission\n\nconst sendMagicLink = async (req, res) => {\n  const { email } = req.body\n  if (!email) return res.status(401).send({ error: 'No email provided' })\n\n  try{\n    // find user in our system by email address\n    let user = await User.findOne({ where: { email } })\n    \n    if (!user) { // create user if none exist\n      user = await User.create({ email })\n    }\n\n    // set the external Stytch foreign key to user_id on Stytch\n    if (!user.stytchId) {\n      const { results } = await stytchClient.users.search({\n        limit: 1,\n        cursor: '',\n        query: {\n          operator: stytch.UserSearchOperator.AND,\n          operands: [\n            {\n              filter_name: 'email_address',\n              filter_value: [email],\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      })\n\n      // use the user_id of the found user or create a new user with the email\n      const { user_id } = results.length ? results[0] : (await stytchClient.users.create({ email }))\n      \n      // update local user with user_id from Stytch\n      user = await user.update({ stytchId: user_id })\n    }\n\n    // create the MagicLink token\n    const { status_code: status, token } = await stytchClient.magicLinks.create({ user_id: user.stytchId })\n\n    // if the token was successfully created, then send email with Enveloop\n    if (status === 200) {\n      await enveloop.sendMessage({\n        to: user.email,\n        template: 'magic-link',\n        templateVariables: { url: `${process.env.STYTCH_REDIRECT_URL}?token=${token}&stytch_token_type=magic_links` },\n      })\n    }\n\n    res.status(status).send({ status })\n  } catch (err) {\n    logError(err)\n    const { status_code: status, error_message: error } = err\n\n    if (status && error) {\n      res.status(status).send({ status, error })\n    } else {\n      res.status(500).send(err)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou'll notice in the templateVariables key, we have a spot for our {{{ url }}} variable and the URL that we created earlier that includes the Embedded Magic Link token from Stytch.\n\n\nUse the Express Endpoint Function for Authentication\n\nconst authenticateMagicLink = async (req, res) => {\n  \n\tconst urlQueryObject = url.parse(req.url, true).query;\n\n\tstytchClient.magicLinks.authenticate(urlQueryObject.token, {session_duration_minutes: 60})\n\t  .then(\n\t\t  // on success render the logged in view\n      res.render(\"Welcome! You're logged in!\")\n    )\n    .catch(err => {\n\t    res.status(500).send(err)\n    });\n\t}\n};\n\nThe final step is to set up an Express endpoint that authenticates the end user once they click on the URL from the email Enveloop delivered. Simply call the Authenticate Magic Link endpoint and pass in the Embeddable Magic Link token with an optional session duration.s And that’s it! The end user is logged in.\n\n\nWrapping up\n\nWith Enveloop and Stytch, end users receive a Log In email that includes a button linked to the Embeddable Magic Link. With one click, the user is authenticated, provided a session, and granted access to your application — all without having to enter a password.\n\nStytch makes it easy for your users to authenticate.

The primary focus is to help developers understand how to harness Enveloop’s capabilities to enhance their applications and user experience.</p><p><strong>Transactional emails</strong> are a critical part of your application’s communication strategy. These emails, including user notifications, password resets, and purchase confirmations, have a direct impact on user engagement and satisfaction. They are often critical in the early stages of familiarizing new users to the value and quality of your service.</p><p><strong>Enveloop</strong> is designed with developers in mind, making it a powerful tool for improving transactional email experiences in your applications. In this series, we’ll show you how to leverage all that Enveloop has to offer by recreating popular transactional emails.</p><p><strong>First up: Netflix.</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">💡</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Did you know?

We’ll rename the section to <strong><code>Image Header</code></strong> to help keep things organized.</p><p>Next, let’s add the image. With Enveloop, you can upload an image or provide an image URL. In this instance, we’re going to upload an image and then set the image width to <strong><code>100%</code></strong> so that it takes up the entire image section.</p><p>You might notice that there still seems to be some padding around the image, preventing it from taking up the entire container. All sections come with some padding by default to give content some space, but we can easily remove this under “Section Style”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular\"

The primary focus is to help developers understand how to harness Enveloop’s capabilities to enhance their applications and user experience.\n\nTransactional emails are a critical part of your application’s communication strategy. These emails, including user notifications, password resets, and purchase confirmations, have a direct impact on user engagement and satisfaction. They are often critical in the early stages of familiarizing new users to the value and quality of your service.\n\nEnveloop is designed with developers in mind, making it a powerful tool for improving transactional email experiences in your applications. In this series, we’ll show you how to leverage all that Enveloop has to offer by recreating popular transactional emails.\n\nFirst up: Netflix.\n\n💡Did you know? Enveloop has a free public builder that allows you to create an email without setting up an account. Simply go to https://app.enveloop.com/try to get started!\n\n\nSetting Up Your Template\n\nWe’re going to jump right into the template creation. You can follow along by adding a new template to your project or you can use our Enveloop public builder.\n\nHere’s the template we are going to create:\n\nFirst, we’re going to add a new blank template. You could always start with one of our pre-built templates, but for this example, we want to start from scratch so we can walk through the process in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:12\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s establish some of our template defaults by going to Template Style.\n\nText Color: #FFFFFF\nLink Color: #d32f27\nBackground Color: #141414\nContent Background Color: #000000\nWidth: 550\nVertical Padding: 30px\nHorizontal Padding: 10px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:31\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy establishing our template styles, we are able to speed up the rest of our template creation. These can always be overwritten at the section and element level.\n\n\nAdding a Header\n\nNow that we have our template styles established, let’s move on to adding a header to our template.\n\nThe header for the Netflix template is pretty simple since it consists of a single large image.\n\nAdd a new section and select, Image. We’ll rename the section to Image Header to help keep things organized.\n\nNext, let’s add the image. With Enveloop, you can upload an image or provide an image URL. In this instance, we’re going to upload an image and then set the image width to 100% so that it takes up the entire image section.\n\nYou might notice that there still seems to be some padding around the image, preventing it from taking up the entire container. All sections come with some padding by default to give content some space, but we can easily remove this under “Section Style”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:21\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Content\n\nWith our header complete, we’ll get started with the content of the email.\n\nAdd a new section and select, Heading.\n\nNext, add your heading text and then change the font size to 36px.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:13\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're going to add another element to this section, so let's rename the section from Heading to Content. Now, add a new Text element. Once you add the text content, increase the font size to 16px and the line-height to 135%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:25\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, add a Button element in the same Content section. Add the text to the button and then change the following values:\n\nFont Size: 13px\nFont Weight: 800\nVertical Button Padding: 15px\nHorizontal Button Padding: 80px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:25\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Footer\n\nIt's time to wrap up this template with the footer.\n\nFirst, add a new blank section and rename it to Footer. Change the layout to Two Columns, 1:2. There are now two column containers to which you can add elements.\n\nNow, let's start with Column 1 Elements. Add a new Image element and upload the image. Set the height on this image to 50px.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:26\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis footer section is unique in that we don't want it to inherit a couple of our default template styles we established earlier (text color and link color). We can override those either on the individual element or on the section. Since this section handles all of the text and link colors the same, let's go ahead and override the defaults on the section and set the following values:\n\nText color: #8D8B8B\nLink color: #8D8B8B\nElement spacing: 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:06\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's move to Column 2 Elements. This column has a lot of text that varies in size. With this in mind, we're going to add each area as a separate text element to have better control over the size and spacing of each item.\n\nLet's add the first Text element. We're going to use markdown to add a link to this text. For the URL, let's use a variable so we can pass along that value through the API. If you don't want to use a variable, simply type in the URL of the link.\n\nNext, we'll add the second Text element and adjust the font size to 10px.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:25\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's add a third Text element to the Footer section. This element will contain a series of links so we'll use markdown to create those. Again, if you want to type the full URL for each link, you may do so or you can use a variable to pass that value along through the API.

You can sign up for free at: <a href=\"https://app.enveloop.com\">https://app.enveloop.com</a>.</div></div><p>Historically, using other email sending tools, both small and large providers, we always experienced difficulty (ok, pain) finding the information that we needed. To us, it seemed as though the built-in logging that was an after-thought. <strong>This is a big deal.</strong></p><p>Ok, so why is it a big deal? You, as a developer, can send messages, but once they are in the wild, in the hands of your users, you need to have confidence in what your users received and you need to have as much useful information in your hands when supporting your users. Traditional email sending tools do not offer what you need.</p><p>So, when building Enveloop, we wanted to re-imagine how email and text message logging could be built when efficiency &amp; speed-to-answer was the primary focus.</p><p><strong>Introducing: Enveloop Message Logging.</strong> Simply put, it's the best message logging system for email and text providers on the market. We put a lot of effort into making it not only enjoyable to use, but as fast, responsive, and efficient as possible.</p><p>Here are highlights of the core features we included:</p><h3 id=\"live-paused-logging\">Live / Paused Logging</h3><p>As you are watching message logs, all events show live: new messages being sent, message statuses changing, events happening. Plus, as you scroll, the logging can be paused while you look for a specific message. This way, you are not having results move around as you diagnose an issue.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption\" data-kg-thumbnail=\"https://blog.enveloop.com/content/media/2024/02/live-logs-1_thumb.jpg\" data-kg-custom-thumbnail=\"\">\n            <div class=\"kg-video-container\">\n                <video src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/02/live-logs-1.mp4\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/2476x800/0a/spacer.png\" width=\"2476\" height=\"800\" loop=\"\" autoplay=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" preload=\"metadata\" style=\"background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/02/live-logs-1_thumb.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;\"></video>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-overlay\">\n                    <button class=\"kg-video-large-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-player-container kg-video-hide\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-video-player\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Pause video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <rect x=\"3\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                                <rect x=\"14\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class=\"kg-video-current-time\">0:00</span>\n                        <div class=\"kg-video-time\">\n                            /<span class=\"kg-video-duration\">0:07</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-seek-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"0\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-playback-rate\" aria-label=\"Adjust playback speed\">1×</button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-unmute-icon\" aria-label=\"Unmute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Mute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-volume-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"100\">\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <figcaption><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Easily transition from live logging to paused and back to live again.</span></p></figcaption>\n        </figure><p>Ready to resume?

You can sign up for free at: https://app.enveloop.com.\n\nHistorically, using other email sending tools, both small and large providers, we always experienced difficulty (ok, pain) finding the information that we needed. To us, it seemed as though the built-in logging that was an after-thought. This is a big deal.\n\nOk, so why is it a big deal? You, as a developer, can send messages, but once they are in the wild, in the hands of your users, you need to have confidence in what your users received and you need to have as much useful information in your hands when supporting your users. Traditional email sending tools do not offer what you need.\n\nSo, when building Enveloop, we wanted to re-imagine how email and text message logging could be built when efficiency & speed-to-answer was the primary focus.\n\nIntroducing: Enveloop Message Logging. Simply put, it's the best message logging system for email and text providers on the market. We put a lot of effort into making it not only enjoyable to use, but as fast, responsive, and efficient as possible.\n\nHere are highlights of the core features we included:\n\n\nLive / Paused Logging\n\nAs you are watching message logs, all events show live: new messages being sent, message statuses changing, events happening. Plus, as you scroll, the logging can be paused while you look for a specific message. This way, you are not having results move around as you diagnose an issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:07\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to resume? Simply click to the Resume button to return to live logging.\n\nAlong with the live or paused logging, we've included infinite scrolling. Clicking through page after page of pagination is slow drudgery. Along with powerful filtering, which we discuss next, you can quickly scroll to what you are looking for in the logs.\n\n\nAll the Filters\n\nWe make it as easy as possible to visually scan logs and find messages that you want to focus on.

Plus, they were wanting a path to remove all email-related code and cruft from their apps.</p><p><strong>Our goal: </strong>Take away all that complexity and pain, make it easy for devs to delegate design and content to their team, and wrap it all in a simple-to-use API call.</p><p>But, we wanted to take it a step further – allowing you to do all your email design, tracking, and, now, <strong><em>sending</em></strong> in one spot: Enveloop. </p><p><strong>Announcing: Enveloop Send!</strong></p><p>You can easily configure and send from an individual email address or sending on entire domains – across all your teams and projects – without needing a separate backend message provider.

Adding your domain only takes a moment. Plus, we provide you <strong>proper DKIM settings</strong> to add to your domain to ensure proper sending authentication. Also, Enveloop handles all SPF settings automatically.</li><li><strong>Logging</strong>. The best logging in the industry. Seriously.

We continued to hear stories of developers struggling with message deliverability and fighting semantically correct HTML and CSS. Plus, they were wanting a path to remove all email-related code and cruft from their apps.\n\nOur goal: Take away all that complexity and pain, make it easy for devs to delegate design and content to their team, and wrap it all in a simple-to-use API call.\n\nBut, we wanted to take it a step further – allowing you to do all your email design, tracking, and, now, sending in one spot: Enveloop.\n\nAnnouncing: Enveloop Send!\n\nYou can easily configure and send from an individual email address or sending on entire domains – across all your teams and projects – without needing a separate backend message provider. Enveloop does it all!\n\nQuick note: Still want to keep your email provider, but use Enveloop for all your message template design and management? No problem – our integrations got you covered!\n\n\nBenefits\n\nLet's take a moment to look into some of the benefits that you receive from using Enveloop Send as your primary email provider.\n\n * Authentication. Adding your domain only takes a moment. Plus, we provide you proper DKIM settings to add to your domain to ensure proper sending authentication. Also, Enveloop handles all SPF settings automatically.\n * Logging. The best logging in the industry. Seriously. Find out more in: Enveloop Logging.\n * Verified Senders. Don't have full access to your company domain – or not sure you are ready to go all-in with Enveloop yet? You can still verify individual company email addresses and then start sending.\n * DMARC Monitoring. Our team closely monitors all DMARC reports and will alert you as to any issues.\n\nSo far, so good. Interested in how to set things up? Let's dive into a quick example to show you the steps involved!\n\n\nSending with a Domain Name\n\nOnce you've created your Enveloop account and are ready to set up sending, choose Mail Settings, located in the left-side navigation.\n\nClick on the Add Sender ID button.\n\nYou'll be prompted to enter a domain name (for example: reallyredpanda.com). Add the domain name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:09\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the domain has been saved, Enveloop will present you with a DKIM TXT record. You will add this record your domain.\n\n(If you need specific help on how to do this with your domain hosting solution, please let us know. We're happy to assist.)\n\nOnce back in Enveloop, you'll notice a Yellow Shield icon. This icon will remain in place for a few moments until Enveloop verifies that your TXT record was saved correctly.\n\nThere is nothing more you need to do at this point – Enveloop will continue to check your domain every 20-30 seconds to verify everything is proper. The entire process should take around 60 seconds.\n\nOnce the domain-based DKIM record has been verified, you'll see a Green Shield icon. From there, you are all set to start sending!\n\nDefault From. Now that your domain is set up, you can define a Default From Address and Name for your email templates. You can override this value inside individual templates, but having a default set up is good practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:06\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. Everything is set for you to start sending!\n\n\nVerified Senders\n\nNow that we've discussed sending messages using any email address on a domain name, let's take a quick look at a more scoped approach to sending.\n\nSo, why would you want to use a Verified Sender vs. a Domain Name? A verified sender is a great option for:\n\n * Using Enveloop to send messages when you do not control or have access to your domain name.\n * You want to test out Enveloop and aren't ready to add settings to your domain record. (It's cool – we totally understand!)\n\nLet's take a brief moment to look at how this works!\n\n\nAdding a Verified Sender\n\nAfter logging into Enveloop, go the Mail Settings, located in the left-side navigation, for the team/project you want to add a sender to.\n\nOnce in mail settings, click on the Add Sender ID button.\n\nAfter that, you'll be prompted to enter the email address you want to send from. Once added, click the Add Sender ID button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:05\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Enveloop will send you an email to that address, starting the process of verifying your access for sending.\n\nUntil you verify the email, you will note that Enveloop shows as having an incomplete setup or a Yellow shield.\n\nOnce the email address has been verified, you'll see a Green Shield icon.

Its modular approach makes it easy to adopt and implement incremental adoption to authentication needs and add more capabilities as the needs of your app change and mature.\n\nHere are a few examples of functionality Devise provides starting out:\n\n * Basic password-based authentication\n * Confirmable email registrations\n * Recoverable password mechanisms\n * Tracking user sessions and history\n\nAll this, of course, requires transactional email and text messages to be sent to an end user, providing important links that guide them through various authentication steps when using your applications.\n\nWhile support from the Devise community has made it easy to get Devise integrated with your Rails app, once you start sending emails to users, you are tasked with the work of making those emails not only look legitimate to email servers, but also legitimate to end users, matching the design and branding of your company or website.\n\nThat's where Enveloop can help!\n\nEnveloop makes it easy for your whole team to design and send crafted emails and text messages. As a developer, it empowers you to send better communication to your users. Plus, you have the option to use Devise, and delegate the content and design to someone else on your team to manage with Enveloop.\n\nIn this article, we're demonstrating how easy it is to set up Enveloop to work with Devise in your Rails app. Once implemented, you'll be sending branded emails that look great, arrive with high deliverability, and are easy to track. Enveloop, like Devise, is optimized for a fantastic developer experience.\n\n\nCreating an Enveloop Account\n\nIf you haven't created an Enveloop account yet, it's free to sign up and only takes 30-45 seconds and you are all set to go. You'll need this when going through the steps in this article.\n\nWe won't dig into all the features that Enveloop offers to developers. We've shared that elsewhere. Our focus with Enveloop is to provide you with a fantastic service that makes it easy to send emails and texts while reducing complexity in your app.\n\n\nUsing Enveloop with Devise\n\nOnce you have created and set up your Enveloop account, integrating with Devise is quite easy. Once complete, you can send emails, via a verified sender or a full domain, from Enveloop, using Devise.\n\n👋Need help with Devise? This article assumes that, while Enveloop may be a bit new to you, you have an understanding of Ruby on Rails and the Devise plug-in. If you need help, let us know at hey@enveloop.com! We're happy to point you in the right direction.\n\nBefore stepping through everything, here is the code to a full Enveloop Mailer class that we will be building. If this is the only illustration you need, perfect! However, if you want to dig in and learn a bit more, follow along as we walk through the implementation.\n\nclass EnveloopMailer < Devise::Mailer\n\n  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\n\n  def confirmation_instructions(user, token)\n    enveloop.send_message(\n      template: \"confirm-account\"\n      to: user.email\n      template_variables: {\n        account_url: user_confirmation_url(confirmation_token: token)\n      }\n    )\n  end\n\n  def reset_password_instructions(user, token)\n    enveloop.send_message(\n      template: \"forgot-password\",\n      to: user.email\n      template_variables: {\n        reset_url: edit_user_password_url(reset_password_token: token)\n      }\n    )\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def enveloop\n    @enveloop ||= Enveloop::Client.new(api_key: ENVELOOP_API_TOKEN)\n  end\n  \nend\n\n\nGetting info from Enveloop\n\nStill with us? Awesome. Let's go.\n\nA couple of quick housekeeping items before we get too far: setting up a sender and knowing where your API key is.\n\nSenders\n\nIn Enveloop, you'll need to make sure that you have created a verified sender or set up your domain with Enveloop. If you need help, we created an article called: blah that shows how to do this. It only takes a few moments.\n\nAPI Keys in Enveloop\n\nOne additional piece of information you need to be sure to have is your API key. Enveloop API keys are provided for each Project within your Enveloop account (you can have multiple projects).\n\nIn Enveloop, choose a project, select Settings and your API token will be available in the General tab. Of note, you start out with a Production and Test API key. The Test key is sandboxed and great for seeing how Enveloop works without sending any emails into the real world.\n\n\nCreate a Template in Enveloop\n\nOk, before we talk code, in your Enveloop account, you'll need to be sure that you have a template available. In the example today, we are going to use the action of requesting that a user confirm their account – a user confirmation email.\n\nEnveloop includes some nice pre-built templates that you can add, saving you from starting with a blank canvas. In your Enveloop account, for your project, do this:\n\n 1. Select Templates from the left navigation.\n 2. Select Add Template from the button on the right.\n 3. Select Email templates.\n 4. From the Stellar templates, select Confirm Account.\n 5. Select Add Template.\n\nNow, as you can see, you have a nicely designed email template that's fully ready to be sent.\n\nIf you click on the Confirm Your Email button in the email template, in the Button properties on the right, you will see a Url input with the value {{{account_url}}}. In the code, we'll be demonstrating how to pass that value, from Devise, to Enveloop before sending out the Confirmation Email.\n\nOk, now that we have the email template created, and our sending information set up, let's look at the code we'll need in our Rails app.\n\n\nThe Code – Finally\n\nThe scenario is simple: A user visits your web application, signs up, and creates an account. You, as a developer, want to send the user an email to confirm the accuracy of the email address submitted. Your template:\n\nOf note, in your Enveloop account, we are calling this the confirm-account template. This can be found in the Deploy tab for this template inside Enveloop. It's not super-important now – just know that we'll use this information later.\n\nLet's set up Devise and Enveloop in your Rails app!\n\nInstall the Enveloop Ruby Gem\n\nYou can visit the Enveloop Ruby repo at: https://github.com/enveloophq/enveloop-ruby\n\ngem install enveloop\n\nInstallation takes only a moment and documentation in the README steps you through how to use the gem. We'll be using some of the calls in the steps that follow.\n\nSet up Devise Confirmable\n\nAssuming you have added Devise to your Rails project and have created a base authentication implementation, your next step is to send out a confirmation email to a user to verify their email address.\n\nThis is accomplished using the Confirmable model, provided as part of Devise. The important information we'll need when sending the email is:confirmation_token.\n\nOverride the Mailer\n\nThe simplest way to do this is to create an EnveloopMailer class that inherits and overrides the default Devise::Mailer.\n\nclass EnveloopMailer < Devise::Mailer\n\n  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\n\n  \nend\n\n\n\nWhile we are at it, we'll go ahead and add in url_helpers because we are going to need it anyway.\n\nSet up a Connection to Enveloop with the API Key\n\nFrom here, let's add a private method to create a client connection to Enveloop from our app. This code assumes you created a ENV var for the API token you grabbed from your Enveloop account earlier.\n\nclass EnveloopMailer < Devise::Mailer\n\n  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\n\n\n  private\n\n  def enveloop\n    @enveloop ||= Enveloop::Client.new(api_key: ENVELOOP_API_TOKEN)\n  end\n  \nend\n\nMethod to Send a Confirmation Email\n\nThe next step is to create a method to send the email. As you may have noticed, this combines the capabilities of Devise with the capabilities of the Enveloop gem.\n\nclass EnveloopMailer < Devise::Mailer\n\n  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\n\n  def confirmation_instructions(user, token)\n    enveloop.send_message(\n      template: \"confirm-account\"\n      to: user.email\n    )\n  end\n\n\n  private\n\n  def enveloop\n    @enveloop ||= Enveloop::Client.new(api_key: ENVELOOP_API_TOKEN)\n  end\n  \nend\n\nHere, we are going to pass in a user record (user) and a token (generated by Devise and associated with the user).\n\nInside this function, we are going to call the send_message method, available in Enveloop, to send a message using our confirm-acount template. This template is the name of the template that we created in the earlier example.\n\nCalling this template will include all the HTML and CSS saved in the template. But, what about the user-specific (or dynamic data) we need to include in the email? Enveloop has template variables for this.\n\nTemplate Variables\n\nEnveloop makes it simple to pass in, interact with, and display dynamic data in the form of variables that you can include in your call.\n\nclass EnveloopMailer < Devise::Mailer\n\n  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\n\n  def confirmation_instructions(user, token)\n    enveloop.send_message(\n      template: \"confirm-account\"\n      to: user.email\n      template_variables: {\n        account_url: user_confirmation_url(confirmation_token: token)\n      }\n    )\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def enveloop\n    @enveloop ||= Enveloop::Client.new(api_key: ENVELOOP_API_TOKEN)\n  end\n  \nend\n\nUsing this method, you can see the template_variables object. It takes a a block of JSON and will pass that information each time an email is called and sent. In this example, we are creating and passing a URL that, when the user clicks a button, will confirm their email address.\n\n👋Iterators! Iterators are outside the scope of this article, however you can pass objects in your template_variables block and, with Enveloop, you can iterate those objects to generate content, dynamically, in your emails. It's pretty cool!\n\nMaking the Call\n\nOk, now that we have our method built, using both Devise and Enveloop functionality, all is ready. Now, in your application, when you have a new sign up and want to send out a confirmation email, you call the confirmation_instructions method, and a beautifully designed email, using Devise-issued tokens, will be sent to your user.\n\nEven better, now you can share that template with others on your team and they can update the content, add in new designs, change the title, etc. without requiring any code changes on your end.

Themes allows you create and manage color settings across all your Enveloop message templates. This empowers your design efforts and simplifies design & branding controls.\n\nWith Enveloop Themes, you can now:\n\n * Create color themes for your message templates.\n * Apply consistent design/branding as you build.\n * Move themes from one template to another.\n * Update colors globally, allowing you to try new design ideas.\n * Find where all your template colors are used.\n\nBut, what's really powerful about themes – colors used in themes have assigned names and these names are accessible via the Enveloop API. This means you can update the design of a message as you are sending it. For example: With a base template design in place, you can alter the template in real-time to use the design, branding, and logos of your customer. Check out the Enveloop API Docs for more info!\n\nHere are some highlights!\n\n\nIt's Simple to Add and Edit Themes\n\nNow, in Enveloop, you can centralize and define all your colors. This makes it easy to update colors as your design changes. Also, you have contextual awareness of the colors you do use in your templates – providing you consistency and structure, especially as different team members make updates to your message templates.\nAll your colors are located in an accessible theme toolbox, available to be used.\n\n\nExtend Themes to All Your Templates\n\nWith theme copy and paste, once you have created a theme, you can easily move it from one template to the next. This allows you to consistently apply your design and branding elements across all your emails and texts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:14\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, where are all these colors used?\n\nFor all the colors that you have in your theme, you can roll over each one to see all the places the color is currently used in your email template. This helps you to know what all sections and elements will be affected by any color changes that you make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:04\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Themes to Come!\n\nThese are a few of the highlights of Theme functionality in Enveloop.
